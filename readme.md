# NutriWise – Data-Driven Meal Planner
## Overview
NutriWise is an intelligent meal planning application that provides personalized Indian meal recommendations based on a user's Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR), dietary preferences, and health goals. It features a Tkinter GUI, an interactive recommendation system, and an optional GMM cluster visualization to showcase the nutritional relationship between different food items.
## Features
1. Personalized Meal Planning – Calculates BMR and recommends meals based on macronutrient targets.
2. Vegetarian & Non-Vegetarian Options – Users can filter meal choices based on dietary preferences.
3. Randomized Meal Suggestions – Users can generate new meal plans dynamically.
4. GMM-Based Clustering (Optional Visualization) – Uses Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) and PCA to group foods based on nutritional content.
5. Modular & Maintainable Codebase – Structured into separate modules for data processing, recommendations, GUI, and visualization.
## Installation & Setup
1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://https://github.com/shreymadd/Nutriwise-Data-Driven-_Meal_Planner.git
cd NutriWise
```
2. Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)
```bash
python -m venv .venv
```
For Windows:
```bash
.\.venv\Scripts\activate
```

## Troubleshooting & Common Issues
Matplotlib Not Found
If you see:
```plaintext
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'matplotlib'
```
Install it manually:
```bash
pip install matplotlib
```
Tkinter Issues (Linux Users)
If Tkinter isn't installed:
```bash
sudo apt-get install python3-tk
```
Module Import Errors
If you see:
```plaintext
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'modules'
```
Ensure you’re running Python inside the project folder:
```bash
